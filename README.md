- 👋 Hi, I’m @cameronsills1001 or as the rest of the world calls me, Cameron (or "Hey you!")
- 👀 I’m interested in web and simple game development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development/javascript. My learning is currently front end but I've been dabbling with Node.js for curiosity and on codewars.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. If there are any Christian or conservative based projects I'd be really excited to join in. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... email. cameronsills1001@protonmail.com
